Here are the topics Iâ€™ve learned. You can use this as a roadmap to go from building basic to advanced [React](https://react.dev) apps using [Vite](https://vite.dev), including some testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com).

  2. Open the folder in VSCode.
  3. Open the terminal and run:

      ```
      npm create vite@latest
      
      # Choose options:

  4. Then run:
      ```
